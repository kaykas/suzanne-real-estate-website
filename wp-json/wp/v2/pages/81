When I became a Licensed Real Estate Broker<\/p>\n<p>I have been a repeat licensed, million dollar producing Realtor and Business Owner for the past 40+ years! My Real Estate career began with the franchise Coldwell Banker and then a move to Re\/max Integrity Real Estate before starting my own <strong>Independent<\/strong> Boutique Brokerage in 2001. Residential, Commercial and Investment properties and Mortgages are all areas that I am familiar with.<\/p>\n<p>I strive to maintain the best quality of service for my clients and stay on the cutting edge of ever changing technology and information. Knowledge in an industry is a beautiful thing and was what motivated me to branch out and learn the Mortgage Business and become a licensed Loan Originator in 2001. I maintained dual Licenses in the State of Oregon for these years. The 14 years of dual exposure as a Licensed Realtor and a Licensed Loan Originator added countless benefits to my Real Estate Services and ultimately, enabl(ed) me to serve my family of clients more efficiently and effectively.<\/p>\n<p>To understand my pivot to my Real Estate career please let me give you a little of my background.<\/p>\n<p>Simultaneously 1978-2001, I was involved in the Marketing and Promotion of the Arts with International Entertainment through Regional and Local Businesses, Education and the Community where I owned and operated Regal Productions, an independent local Entertainment Promotion Business that contracted, marketed and promoted International Entertainers.<\/p>\n<p>I promoted the first Rock and Roll show in the grand opened Hult Center in 1982 and then Harry Belafonte as the last performer I brought to our community (2001) but not without many performers in between. To name a few: Linda Ronstadt, Sade, Huey Lewis and The News, Joe Cocker, Tom Jones, George Strait, Crystal Gayle, Natalie Cole, UB 40, James Brown, The Temptations,Tony Bennet, Simply Red, David Copperfield,Ray Charles, The Bangles, Toto,B52s, Toto, LadySmith Black Mambazo, Ziggy Marley, Wynton Marsalis and The Smothers Brothers. The entertainment business has many challenging variables (like Real Estate). I had many rich and unique &#8220;hands on&#8221; life experiences that sharpened my business\/life skills in numerous areas. These invaluable experiences enabled me to promote Oregon, Lane County, the Eugene\/Springfield area, the Hult Center, the Cuthbert Amphitheatre and the Schnitzer Concert Hall in PDX to local patrons, national and international entertainers, their agencies (based in LA and NY) and staff, as well as, assisting in a type of Ambassadorship to establish the Hult Center for the Performing Arts Center, as a viable stop for entertainment performances in Oregon. In addition, I held a contract as an Independent local Promoter with the City of Eugene in the capacity of co-sponsor of numerous performances for 8 years.<\/p>\n<p>I have cross promoted and co- sponsored International Entertainment events with hundreds of Local, Regional and National businesses. I consider myself very fortunate to have had a career niche which was a unique and wonderful platform to facilitate and endorse local organizations working for a richer- more inclusive, diversified and elevated community environment. I was able to get to know many of the community driven business services as well as top notch, local Art groups up close and who are the thread of the fabric- that make up this State,County, its residents and our communities where we live.<\/p>\n<p>I am fortunate to also be the Mom of two sons, a daughter in law and have grandchildren (rapidly growing up), whom I adore. They have individually expanded my depth and allowed me the joy of watching new generations grow up. This honor reminds me every day of the importance of our actions today and the effects it has on the future which directly impacts our communities and where we live.<\/p>\n<p>My oldest son is at Lytics. A Portland based firm that utilizes his top notch analytical,marketing and managerial expertise. My daughter in law is in the green technology industry and my youngest son joined me in the Real Estate profession where we perfected a family based business experience (and is currently on pause from it) while he became licensed to help facilitate the growth of children who are on the spectrum (he is also a talented Musician).<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, I also have multi generational hands on experience through volunteering with many non profit local and national organizations throughout the years and in our local public school system: in the classroom, on field trips, as well as on the field and courts as a basketball timekeeper, baseball scorekeeper, soccer coach, debate referee, in\/after\/school activities not limited to- but including high school student counseling for college scholarship programs.<\/p>\n<p>What a joy and journey&#8230; it continues to be!<\/p>\n<p>My philosophical approach to business is \u201cold school\u201d. Clear communication that encompasses education of the processes, ethics, honesty, fairness and customer care in every situation.<\/p>\n<p>I take pride in being a team player. I believe that understanding your options as a consumer in a business transaction that has a multitude of changing variables for each individual instance is integral to understanding the process and making clear, informed personal and business decisions.<\/p>\n<p>I believe that your Real Estate experience should be professional and enjoyable and I am honored and take pride in the many repeat clients that I am fortunate to call extended family throughout my career. I am especially humbled by 3rd generation clients.<\/p>\n<p>I enjoy what I do and appreciate the reciprocation from my family, friends, associates and clients.<\/p>\n<p>I look forward to you becoming part of that circle.<\/p>\n<p>Please contact me with any question you might have or information needed- in the next step in your Real Estate plans in which you are considering.<\/p>\n<p>I will look forward to it.<\/p>\n<p>My best, Suzanne<\/p>\n<p>Suzanne Z Kaykas<br \/>\nPrincipal Broker\/Owner<br \/>\nSUZANNE Z KAYKAS REAL ESTATE LLC<\/p>\n<p>Licensed in the State Of Oregon since 1991<br \/>\nFormerly Licensed Mortgage Loan Originator 2001-2014<\/p>\n<p>Further questions?
