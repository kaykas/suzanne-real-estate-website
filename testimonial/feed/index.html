She worked very, very hard for us. If we did not understand something she went over it until we did. She held our hand every step of the way.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;We are happy to recommend Suzanne as a real estate broker! It was such a pleasure to work with her on the purchase of our home. She was patient as we went through the decision making process, and we never felt our questions were frivolous. Suzanne’s professionalism and follow through were greatly appreciated I (Vicki) had a handful of bad experiences with Real Estate transactions previously in prior states that we had lived in. They left me skeptical of the motives of some in the profession. Suzanne changed my opinion of that and not only helped us purchase and sell a property but refinance along the way as well. If you can top that I would only have to add I am now her licensed assistant!&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;When our home sold quickly prior to its listing, my husband and I were not even prepared for the process in searching for a new home. Luckily, we met Suzanne at the third open house we attended. She was our angel who literally took us under her wing and patiently guided us through the long haul of looking at many homes over a length of time and who was comfortable with our timeline. Despite the frustration of my husband and I having two different ideas of where and what our next home should be, Suzanne maintained humor and realtor savvy in her relationship with us. Thank you, Suzanne!&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;We have sung Suzanne’s praises to anyone who’ll listen! She not only found us the perfect old log house, she found us financing, a contractor, inspector…….we can’t say enough. We would never ever consider having anyone but Suzanne help us with buying, selling or financing a house – and that’s a fact.&#8221;</p>
